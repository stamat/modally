# ðŸªŸ Modally [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/modally)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modally)

> Your trusty nested modal ally

If there are many different variations of the same functionality, the rule says it's easy to make. And the same goes for web modal dialogues - they are super easy to make.

I created this web modal dialog library as a repo cause I wrote the same code for every project that required modals, over and over again throughout the years, just because it's trivial and I needed "5 minutes" to make it.

But regardless, **life is short - make reusable code!**

## Installation

```bash
npm i modally
```

Use it as a module
```javascript
import Modally from 'modally';
```

Or as an IIFE script, Modally will be available as a global variable, or as a jQuery plugin if jQuery is present `$(selector).modally(options)`
```html
<script src="path/to/modally.min.js"></script>
```

## Features
* **Simplest one yet** - almost everything is automatic (or at least it should be ðŸ˜…)
* **ESM and IIFE** - use it as a module or as a script
* **HTML auto-wrapped**
* **State body classes**
* **Vertically centered**
* **Scroll blocking** 
* **Nested** - automatic detection, no need for additional coding
* **Video embeddable** - automatic Vimeo and Youtube embeds with autoplay
* **ESC closable**
* **Infinitely customizable** - go f**king wild ðŸŽ‰
* **Can be used with any framework** - no dependencies, no jQuery, no nothing, but you can use it with jQuery if you want to, iife file has a jQuery plugin wrapper `$(selector).modally(options)`

## Usage

### Quick Start
```javascript
	const modally = new Modally();

	//turns your content into a modal, wraps it nicely - be sure to set it to display:none in CSS
	modally.add('your-content');
```
```html
<div id="your-content" style="display:none;"><h1>Hello world!</h1></div>
<a href="#your-content" target="_modal"></a>
```

### Youtube and Vimeo modals

```javascript
const modally = new Modally();

//creates a video modal which looks for data-video and opens a Youtube or Vimeo embed within your modal
modally.add('your-video-modal', {video: true});
```
```html
<a href="#your-video-modal" target="_modal" data-video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9QJo5fBADE">Youtube</a>
<button type="button" target="_modal:open:your-video-modal" data-video="https://vimeo.com/243244233">Vimeo</button>
```

### Advanced Usage

P.S. Here is an oxymoron for you: I'm one of these people who if they have the time to make something they don't use other people's code, not to have to spend time extending it if god forbids it happens to be needed. Life's not so short now, huh?
