# ðŸªŸ Modally [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/modally)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modally)

> Your trusty nested modal ally

If there are many different variations of the same functionality, the rule says it's easy to make. And the same goes for web modal dialogues - they are super easy to make.

I created this web modal dialog library as a repo cause I wrote the same code for every project that required modals, over and over again throughout the years, just because it's trivial and I needed "5 minutes" to make it. It's not 5 minutes of course, it never is. 

**Life is short - make reusable code!**

## Features
* **Simplest one yet** - almost everything is automatic (or at least it should be ðŸ˜…)
* **Nested** - automatic detection of the order or parent, no need for additional coding
* **ESM and IIFE** - use it as a module or as a script
* **HTML auto-wrapped**
* **State body classes**
* **Vertically centered** - doesn't need to be, but it can be
* **Scroll blocking** 
* **Video embeddable** - automatic Vimeo, Youtube and HTML Video embeds with autoplay
* **Image lightbox** - automatic image lightbox
* **ESC closable**
* **Infinitely customizable** - go f**king wild ðŸŽ‰
* **Framework agnostic** - no dependencies, fully native! You can use it with jQuery if you want to, `$(selector).modally(options)` a plugin is available if jQuery is present if you use this library as an IIFE script.

## Installation

### NPM or Yarn

```bash
npm i modally
```

Use it as a module
```javascript
import Modally from 'modally';
```

Or as an IIFE script, Modally will be available as a global class, or as a jQuery plugin if jQuery is present `$(selector).modally(options)`


### CDN
As iife files
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/modally/dist/modally.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://unpkg.com/modally/dist/modally.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Or as a remote module
```javascript
import Modally from 'https://unpkg.com/modally';
```

## Usage

Modally works with IDs. You need to apply a unique ID to each modal. If you are creating a modal from an existing element, it's ID will be used. If you are creating a modal with dynamic content (advanced usage), you need to provide an ID.

### Quick Start

```html
<div id="your-content" hidden><h1>Hello world!</h1></div>
<a href="#your-content" target="_modal"></a>
```

```javascript
const modally = new Modally();

//turns your content into a modal, wraps it nicely
modally.add('your-content');
```

### Youtube and Vimeo modals

```javascript
const modally = new Modally();

//creates a video modal which looks for data-video and opens a Youtube or Vimeo embed within your modal
modally.add('your-video-modal', {video: true});
```
```html
<a href="#your-video-modal" target="_modal" data-video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9QJo5fBADE">Youtube</a>

<button type="button" target="_modal:open:your-video-modal" data-video="https://vimeo.com/243244233">Vimeo</button>
```

### Image lightbox

```javascript
const modally = new Modally();

//creates an image modal which looks for data-image and opens an image within your modal
modally.add('your-image-modal', {image: true});
```
```html
<a href="#your-image-modal" target="_modal" data-image="https://picsum.photos/800/600" data-width="800" data-height="600">Image</a>

<a href="#your-image-modal" target="_modal" data-image="https://picsum.photos/600/800" data-width="600" data-height="800">Image 2</a>
```

### Advanced Usage

```javascript
const modally = new Modally();
modally.add('advanced-example');

document.addEventListener('modally:open:advanced-example', function(e) {
	console.log(e.detail); // Modal instance, contains template, target, element (if any), options, etc.
	console.log(e.detail.target); // Target element, the one that triggered the modal open. If it exists that is, otherwise it is undefined. So in the case of this example it will be the <a> element with href="#advanced-example"
	e.detail.template.querySelector('.modally-content').innerHTML = 'Hello world!';
});
```
```html
<a href="#advanced-example" target="_modal"></a>
```

## Properties

Property | Default | Accepts | Description
-------- | ------- | ------- | -----------
**landing** | `document.body` | string selector or element | where to append the modal window
**maxWidth** | 'none' | 'none' or number | Defines maximum width of the modal window, just like max-width css property
**classes** | '' | string | Additional classes to add to the modal window
**verticalAlign** | 'middle' | 'middle' or 'top' or 'bottom' | Vertical orientation of the modal window, like vertical-align css property
**closeParent** | false | boolean | Whether to close the parent modal window, parent window is automatically selected if a modal open is triggered within another modal
**closeOthers** | false | boolean | Wether to close all other opened modals upon opening this modal
**video** | false | boolean | For creating a video modal
**image** | false | boolean | For creating an image "lightbox" modal
**autoplay** | true | boolean | Whether video modal should autoplay
**template** | default modally template :point-down: | HTML string or element | Template of the modal window

Options can also be assigned via data attributes if you are creating a modal from an element. Attributes are named using the following pattern: `modally-<option-name>`, like so:

```html
<div id="hello-world" modally-max-width="800" modally-vertical-align="top">
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</div>
```

```javascript
const modally = new Modally();
modally.add('hello-world');
```

### Default template

```html
<div class="modally-wrap">
	<div class="modally-table">
		<div class="modally-cell">
			<div class="modally-underlay modally-close"></div>
			<div class="modally" role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
				<button tabindex="1" aria-label="Close" class="modally-close modally-close-button">&times;</button>
				<div class="modally-content"></div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

## Events

Event | Description
----- | -----------
**modally:added** | modal was created
**modally:open** | modal is being opening
**modally:opened** | modal is opened
**modally:close**  | modal is being closed
**modally:closed** | modal is closed

Modally events are named using the following pattern: `namespace:action` where namespace is `modally` and action is one of the above. Or `namespace:action:modal-id` where modal-id is the ID of the modal that is being opened/closed or added.

All events are dispatched on the `document` object and contain a `detail` property with the modal instance.

You can listen to a specific event of a specific modal via it's ID, by creating a listener to the event name consisted of the namespace + action + modal ID, like so:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('modally:open:your-modal-id', function(e) {
	console.log(e.detail); // Modal instance, contains template, target, element (if any), options, etc.
});
```

or you can tune to all events of all modals and then check for the modal ID like so:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('modally:open', function(e) {
	if (e.detail.id === 'your-modal-id') {
		console.log(e.detail); // Modal instance, contains template, target, element (if any), options, etc.
	}
});
```

Events without the modal ID (namespace + action only) are dispatched on the `element` that is used for modal creation and becomes it's content (if it exists of course) and on `template` element as well.

P.S. Here is an oxymoron for you: I'm one of these people who if they have the time to make something they don't use other people's code, not to have to spend time extending it if god forbids it happens to be needed. Life's not so short now, huh?
